# Dynamic Feature Identification in Echocardiograms

This repository contains signal-processing-based algorithms for identifying
dynamic cardiac structures in echocardiogram data. The project focuses on
automatic detection of mitral valve leaflet motion and left ventricle geometry
using classical digital signal processing (DSP) and image analysis techniques,
without the use of learning-based models.

The implementation includes:
- A MATLAB-based pipeline for **mitral valve leaflet detection** using temporal
  motion energy and spatial filtering.
- A Python-based pipeline for **left ventricle identification** using image
  filtering, segmentation, and geometric heuristics.

This work was developed as a final project for a Digital Signal Processing
course at Columbia University.

### Mitral Valve Leaflet Detection (MATLAB)

The mitral valve leaflet detection algorithm is implemented in MATLAB and
operates on echocardiogram video data.

To run the MATLAB pipeline:

1. Open MATLAB
2. Set the current working directory to the root of this repository
3. Run the following command in the MATLAB Command Window:

```matlab
run_me
```
